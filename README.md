Dotfiles
========

Those are my precioussss dotfiles. To setup, clone the repo (or download a tarball) and have a look at the Makefile. Be careful, the make recipes will show no mercy and will override any existing file they may encounter. For a lightspeed "clone + install all" setup, use the following one-liner:

```shell
curl -L https://github.com/Likeyn/dotfiles/raw/master/setup.sh | sh
```
